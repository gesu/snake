# Snake

This is a simple snake game written in es5. The  game plays itself so you don't have to. It uses a very basic algorithm - find the closest food square and try to eat it. This leads to the snake killing itself a lot since it lacks self awareness. So, in many ways, I find this snake to be very relatable.
